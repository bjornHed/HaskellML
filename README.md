# HaskellML
As an experiment I try to implement some common ML algorithms in pure Haskell. Some work, some don't. Also contains random ML projects that are more or less complete. For now contains a Genetic Algorithm and k-means. 

## Snakebot
The snakebot directory details an attempt to train a neural network with a PSO algorithm for playing competetive snake. However due to timeconstraints that idea was scrapped before the competition and is thus left unfinished.
